# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer working [__@methodpark__](https://github.com/methodpark).
Currently I mostly write code in __C__ and __Python__, but I'm trying to learn some __Rust__.

Most of the projects you'll see here are done in my free time, so forgive me if they're missing some UnitTests.
Also some of them are quite old and don't really receive updates anymore. If you have any questions, feel free to create Issues though!

I also am a member of the [__@blackarch__](https://github.com/blackarch) team. Blackarch is a Security Linux Distribution, if you enjoy ArchLinux and Security, give it a try.

Have fun!
